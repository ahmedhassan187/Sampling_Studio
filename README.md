# Signal Sampling Studio

Designing a signal recovery web-application that depicts the Nyquist rate, using streamlit, an open source framework.


## Features
- generating sinusoidal signals at the user-specified frequency and amplitude.
- Reading of csv signal files and the sampled points are marked on the signal.
- Adjusting the sample rate through a slider that ranges from 0 Hz to  Hz.
- Reconstructing the signal from the sampled points.
- The sum of the generated sinusoidals is shown on a single graph.
- A button to delete the user-choosen sinusoidal.
- A slider for adding noise to the signal by a user-specified SNR value.
- Saving the generated sinusoidal to the user's computer using save button.
