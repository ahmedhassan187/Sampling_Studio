# Signal Sampling Studio

Designing a signal recovery web-application that depicts the Nyquist rate, using streamlit, an open source framework.


## Features
- generating sinusoidal signals at the user-specified frequency and amplitude.
- Reading of csv signal files and the sampled points are marked on the signal.
- Adjusting the sample frequency with sample rate slider or slider of maximum frequency scale.
- Reconstructing the signal from the sampled points.
- The sum of the generated sinusoidals, and the reconstructed ones are shown on a single graph, where user can choose which to be shown.
- A button to delete the user-choosen sinusoidal.
- A slider for adding noise to the signal by a user-specified SNR value.
- Saving the reconstructed signal to the user's computer using download button.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

```bash
  streamlit run Demo1.py
```
